Q1

static 101325 Pa and dynamics 61.25 Pa

Q2

21%

Q3

the viscosity increases with increasing rate of deformation

Q4

All flow statistics are invariant
(wrong) The slip condition applies 

Q5

a laminar flow can be steady but also unsteady
turbulent is always unsteady

Q6

an increase in static pressure with a decrease in fluid speed

Q7

The shear stress exerted by a turbulent boundary layer larger than laminar

(Wrong) No-slip imples shear stress is zero ----- should be non-zero

Q8 

A turbulent approach flow  will yield more rapid transition of boundary layer from laminar to turbulent

Symmetrical problems can have asymmetric solutions

Q9 

Pressure recovery in the wake of a bluff body is less good with laminar than turbulent

For a steamlined body, friction drage is more important

Q10

(WRONG) Turbulence in the ABL is lower than free

(WRONG) logarithmic law

(WRONG) Turbulence

ABL is lower during night than day
