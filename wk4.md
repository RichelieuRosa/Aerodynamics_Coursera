Question 6
Which of these four items is the most important problem for natural ventilation studies for buildings at reduced scale in wind tunnels?

10 / 10 points

Solution verification is imperative

Urban surroundings need to be included and as a result the scaling factors become too large and the reduced-scale ventilation openings too small to allow similarity.

Uncontrollable boundary conditions

Low accuracy and reliability

Correct
Indeed,
the reduced scale can lead to similarity constraints that can be important,
certainly for small ventilation openings. Flow through small openings that is
turbulent at full scale, might become transitional or even laminar when these
openings are scaled down.

Question 7
Which is a correct unit for the wind-driven rain intensity on a building facade?


0 / 10 points

Question 8
The wind-blocking effect is an important effect that determines how much wind-driven rain impinges on the windward facade of a building. What does this effect refer to?

0 / 10 points

Subsonic upstream disturbance due to the presence of the building

Blockage of the wind-flow pattern upstream of the building by obstacles such as trees

Blockage of the wind-flow pattern by the presence of raindrops

Reduction of wind
speed in the wake of the building





Incorrect

Wind-blocking
effect refers to blockage of the wind-flow pattern by the building itself.

Question 9
How large is the typical amplification of wind speed that you can achieve with a well-designed venturi-shaped roof such as the Ventec roof designed by Ben Bronsema? The amplification is calculated as the wind speed in the narrowest part of the venturi contraction divided by the upstream (unobstructed) wind speed at the same height.

Question 10
By rotating the actual (current) design of the Bahrain World Trade Center over 180°, the annual wind energy output of its three turbines would increase by 14% up to 1.35 GWh. What is the mean reason for this increased output? 

0 / 10 points

The fact that the wind is channeled in the passage to be almost parallel to the wind turbine axes.

The fact that the prevaling wind direction is almost parallel to the wind turbine axes.

The fact that the towers have a triangular sail-like shape.

The fact that wind speed is increased to a larger extent in a diverging than in a converging arrangement.
